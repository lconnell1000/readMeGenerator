# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator

## The project

For this project we had to make a Readme generator that would be useful and practical to us in real life. It is our first time using Node.js and I really enjoyed this.

When the user enters command-line application, then they are prompted for information about their application repository and a high quality, profession README.md is generated with all the relevant information such as title, desciption, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests and questions. The table of contents is functional upon completion and takes the user to the relevant section of the readme when clicking on them.
